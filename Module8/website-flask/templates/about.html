<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Tomasz Klosinski and I'm a Polish <b>DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer</b> based in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Poland. I started my career in Warsaw, Poland in 2011 as a Linux (RHEL) System Administrator, but in about a year I moved away from pure server administration to work with Cloud and DevOps tools.</p>
<p>I moved to Switzerland in 2014, where I started working at <a href="https://home.cern/about">CERN</a> in Geneva, in the French-speaking part of the country. It was a one-year contract as a Project Associate. I was responsible for modernizing the automation and configuration management stack in the team that was responsible for over 2000 Linux machines operating <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider</a>.</p>
<p>After that I moved to Zug (near Zurich) in German-speaking Switzerland to work for a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology">FinTech</a> bank. Since then, I have continued working in the Swiss FinTech industry.</p>
