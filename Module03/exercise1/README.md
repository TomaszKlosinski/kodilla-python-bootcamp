# Exercise 1

Suppose we have grocery shopping to do, we need to go to the bakery where we buy bread, rolls and a doughnut.
In addition, on the way we will also stop by the grocery shop, where we will buy carrots, celery and arugula.

In a file:
* Define a dictionary containing a shopping list, where the key is the name of the shop and the value is the list of items you want to buy from that shop.
* Then, using a for loop, rewrite over this dictionary and display the caption as: I go to <store> and buy <things> there.
* Additionally, using the built-in methods for subtitle operations, make the names of shops and goods capitalized (refer to the official documentation to find such functionality).
* Finally, on the last line, write out In total, I buy <X> products.... X is the total number of goods that are in the lists.

Your program should display the following information:

    Shopping list
    I go to the Bakery and I buy the following items here: ['Bread', 'Doughnut', 'Bread rolls'].
    I go to the Grocery Shop, and I buy the following items here: ['Carrots', 'Celery', 'Arugula'].
    In total, I buy 6 products.
